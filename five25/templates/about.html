    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">The Inspiration</h3>
    <p>The inspiration for this web application came from two places:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A random <a href="">article</a> I read several months ago involving career advice from billionaire Warren Buffet</li>
      <li>My desire for a more focused approach to learning programming and computer science in general (since my current approach involves drinking from the firehose)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So this app is based off of Warren Buffet’s so called “5-25” rule used to prioritize your career goals.
      Basically, you write a list of 25 of your career goals, then you go and choose the top 5.
      The 20 that you don’t choose are now your “anti-goals”—things you want to do but ultimately,
      are distracting you from your top 5 goals.
    </p>
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">How to Use this Site</h3>
    <p>
      When I started this app, my intent was to walk the user through this process,
      beginning with 25 goals, then selecting 5 and organizing all the goals into a TODO and NOT TODO list.
      I showed my wife and she was like “25 is a lot. Does it need to be that many?”
      Her insight helped me broaden my scope to turn the app into a glorified task list with a similar premise.
      Say you have 10 tasks you want to complete today.
      Choose 2 and the other 8 become your “anti-tasks” — avoid them until you finish your two tasks you chose to focus on!
      Also, if you want you can still create 25 goals and choose the top five.
      I created the app so you can store all your lists and update, delete, or reference them very easily.
      Career goals, weekly goals, summer goals, afternoon tasks, whatever you want.
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to use it, abuse it, make it your own, and above all else, I hope it can help you focus on the goals you truly want to accomplish.</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
