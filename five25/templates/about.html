    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">The Inspiration</h3>
    <br>
    <p>The inspiration for this web application came from several places:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>I read a random <a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/i-just-discovered-warren-buffets-25-5-rule-completely-brilliant.html" target="_blank">
        article</a> several months ago involving career advice from billionaire Warren Buffet.</li>
      <li>I was contemplating ideas for a worthwhile final project to finally finish
        <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science" target="_blank">CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a>.
      </li>
      <li>I was looking for a way to focus my approach to learning programming & web development.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <span class="font-weight-bold">FocusFive25</span> was created to help inspire and increase focus and productivity.
      Although the (current) end result is a pretty neat task list application, the original inpiration came from Warren Buffet’s so called “5-25” rule used to prioritize one's career goals.
    </p>
    <p class="font-weight-bold">The "5-25 Rule" basically goes like this:</p>
    <ul class="about-list">
      <li>Write a list of twenty-five of your career goals, then after some introspection choose the top five.</li>
      <li>The twenty that you don’t choose are now your “anti-goals” &mdash; goals you want to accomplish, but in reality,
        they are goals that are distracting you from your top five goals.
      </li>
      <li>This "rule" is supposed to help you stay focused on your true goals.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3 class="font-weight-bold">How to Use this Application</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
      When I started creating this app, my intent was to walk the user through the whole "5-25" process,
      beginning with twenty-five goals, selecting the top five, and then organizing all the goals into a TO-DO and TO-<span class="font-weight-bold">NOT</span>-DO list.
      I showed my wife, and she said, “Twenty-five is a lot. Does it need to be that many?”
      Her insight helped me broaden the usefulness of the app, and the idea morphed into a straightforward task list that does <span class="font-italic">exactly</span> what I want it to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say you have ten tasks you want to complete today.
      Choose two, and the other eight become your “anti-tasks” &mdash; avoid them until you finish the two tasks you chose to focus on!
      And if you want, you can still follow the "5-25" process to create a list with your twenty-five career goals and select the top five to focus on.
    </p>
    <p>
      I created the app so you can store all your lists and update, delete, or reference them very easily.
      You can create lists of career goals, daily tasks, weekly goals, summer goals, afternoon tasks, or whatever you want!
    </p>
    <p>Feel free to use it however you see fit. Go ahead and make it your own if you'd like. Above all else, I hope it helps you focus on the goals you truly want to accomplish.</p>
    <p>Enjoy!</p>
